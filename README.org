* outxxtra.el- enhanced outline navigation and structure editing

** Credits

This library is based on, or rather an extension of, Per Abrahamsen's
'out-xtra.el' (http://tinyurl.com/aql9p97), and may replace it many cases.
Some new ideas were taken from Fabrice Niessen's '.emacs'
(http://www.mygooglest.com/fni/dot-emacs.html#sec-2).

** Commentary

This file provides (almost) the same nice extra features for outline minor
mode like Per Abrahamsen's 'out-xtra':

- Change default minor mode key prefix to `C-c'.
- Complete keybindings and menu support.
- Add command to show top level headers.
- Add command to hide all other entries than the one containing point.

`outxxtra' follows a different idea than `out-xtra': it consists of generic
functionality that that calculates the adequate outline-regexp and
outline-level for the active major-mode, rather than defining several blocks
of major-mode specific functionality.

New features of `outxxtra' are:

 1. Generic functionality that should work whereever `comment-region' and
    `uncomment-region' work. 
 2. Fontification of headlines (copied from Fabrice Niessen's
    '.emacs')

It is highly recommended to use `outxxtra' together with `outline-magic' for
the Org-style `outline-cycle' command.

** Emacs Version

`outxxtra.el' works with [GNU Emacs 24.2.1 (x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu, GTK+
Version 3.6.4) of 2013-01-20 on eric]. No attempts of testing with older
versions or other types of Emacs have be made (yet).

** Installation

Insert (require 'outxxtra) in your .emacs file to install. If you want a
different prefix key, insert first (defvar outline-minor-mode-prefix "\C-c")
or whatever. The prefix can only be changed before outline (minor) mode is
loaded.

** ChangeLog

| date            | author(s)       | version |
|-----------------+-----------------+---------|
| <2013-02-11 Mo> | Thorsten Jolitz |     0.9 |

** Bugs

`outxxtra' uses a fixed format `outline-regexp' (and `outline-level'), the
one produced when applying `comment-region' on an Org-mode style headline
in the active programming-language major-mode, e.g. 

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; ** Entry
#+end_src

in an Emacs Lisp buffer, or

#+begin_src org
## ** Entry
#+end_src

in an PicoLisp buffer.

This could be make more flexible (and customizable), albeit at the price
that `outorg.el' would not work anymore with `outxxtra'. And - these
Org-style heades look good, why change them?
